# What is this an example for?

This is an example for displaying how to load an html document from within a github repo. I used it do display content from github. It was needed to
 share and preview a chatGPT conversation without just basic recording into video. Now, you may template from this example. And if you're clever enough,
  you should be able to load your code with the repository kept private.
